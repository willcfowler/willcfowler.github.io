		<h2 class="important"> <em> Graphic Design </em> </h2>
			<p> Graphic design is one of my favorite mediums. I like to use Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to create designs and other things. I have created several posters and informational designs over the years. </p>

			<p> Drawing is another medium I like to explore. I had never drawn until my freshman year of college so I am still very new to the concept. I have come to enjoy it more and more as I do it. </p>
